🚀 Data Structure Algorithm and Visualization

📌 Overview

This project is an interactive web-based platform designed to visually represent various Data Structures and Algorithms. It enables users to grasp fundamental concepts through dynamic and animated visualizations, making learning more engaging and intuitive. Built with Streamlit, this tool provides an easy-to-use interface for exploring different data structures and algorithms.

🎯 Features

✔ Data Structures Visualization:

📦 Arrays

📚 Stacks

🔄 Queues

🔗 Linked Lists

🌲 Trees & Graphs

✔ Algorithm Simulation:

🔍 Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)

🔀 Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)

💡 Greedy Algorithms

🔙 Backtracking

✔ Interactive UI:

Users can input custom values and see real-time visual changes.

Step-by-step execution for better understanding.
